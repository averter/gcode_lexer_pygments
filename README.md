# gcode_lexer_pygments
######This is a work in progress####
Anyone who wants to add these lexers to pygments please feel free to do so.
I just didn't do it myself because I don't want to create an account on Bitbucket. Please inform me of any bugs/errors since I'm fairly new to Python.

ansys APDL lexer info:
- based on fortran lexer
- based on https://github.com/dieter-wilhelm/ansys-mode

Installation in Linux 
1- Copy files to /usr/lib/python2.7/dist-packages/pygments/lexers
2- Run in that directory "sudo python _mapping.py"
3- Enjoy!
