# ANSYS and gcode lexers of pygments
######UPDATE#####
This repository is now officially part of pygments 2.9

Anyone who wants to add these lexers to pygments please feel free to do so.
I just didn't do it myself because I don't want to create an account on Bitbucket. Please inform me of any bugs/errors since I'm fairly new to Python.

Example
